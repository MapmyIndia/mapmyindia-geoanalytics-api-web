### Introduction

Geo-Analytics API is an API set that gives the users the power for selection, visualization, queries, styling and analytics on the data which is archived in MapmyIndia’s pan-India database and overlay on MapmyIndia’s Maps service for web.

The API set also has the capability to integrate with client data as overlays.

The APIs are OGC compliant and currently the following frameworks or libraries are supported by Geo-Analytics APIs for displaying map data on any web app.

### Usage

Through the use of various methods offered by said libraries, clients can lay-out the complex and rich Map data set offered by MapmyIndia in the simplest way to geo-visualize their data and perform business analytics using location variable.

The various APIs offered through GeoAnalytics platform of MapmyIndia (but not limited to) are:
1. State as a layer.
2. City as a layer.
3. District as a layer
4. Subdistrict as a layer.
...

All of these layers come with the additional styling and control options such as: 
- label attributes (toggle ON/Off, colors, size)
- fill layer with color
- size of any point data.
- border attributes (color, width)
- opacity control.
...

### Rich Attributes - Seamless linkage to Geographical Layers

In addition to these layers and above defined basic functions, comes the power to query the said layers on the basis of multiple  attributes like demographics, awareness etc. (PREMIUM FEATURE).
e.g. One can show only those states pan India whose "population" is greater than the client defined value.

#### Available Attributes 
1. **Demographics** attributes like
	- *Population* related attributes like `total male population` in an administrative geometrical layer (e.g. in a district)
	- *Literacy* attributes in a layer (e.g. `female literates` in a town)
	- and many more ...
2. **Amenities / Socio-Economic** attributes like 
	- `Mobile Phone coverage availability` in a layer. (e.g. in a ward)
	- `Power supply for commercial use availability` in a layer. (e.g. in a village)
	- and many more ... 
3. **Awareness / Penetration** attributes like
	- `ATM availability` in a layer (e.g. in a village)
	- `Household having four wheeler` in a layer (e.g. in a block)
	- and many more ...

## Why GeoAnalytics APIs?

 - Reduced dependence on raw vector data, which directly reduces the vast amount of time spent in processing data updates.
 - To make the visualization and analytics lightning fast by providing a standardized DaaS (data-as-a-service) approach to fetching rich geographical data-sets - no need to fetch data directly from custom databases - geoAnalytics APIs are following industry standard (OGC) of serving data to end user for geospatial information and analytics.
